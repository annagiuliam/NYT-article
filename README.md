This is a project part of the CSS/HTML section of The Odin Project course.
The goal is to recreate the layout of this article of the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) in order to practice what I learned about floating, positioning, Flexbox and Grid.
